Primary Bug at the moment involves the creation of the graphs
In the current setup, there are two plotter objects that create two graphs, one for cpu, and one for ram.

It is configured so that the plotter.plot_graph() method now ends with plt.figure() not plt.show().
The plt.show() is called at the end.

This creates both graphs for cpu and ram as intended.

However, an empty graph is also created

This needs to be remediated
